# Bike Sharing Weather Impact Analysis

This repository contains analysis and visualization of how weather conditions affect bike sharing demand. The analysis is based on the [Bike Sharing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset) which contains hourly and daily data of bike rentals in the city of Washington, D.C.

---

## Project Overview

- Explore the relationship between weather variables (temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation) and bike sharing demand.
- Perform statistical analysis and visualization to understand demand patterns.
- Build simple regression models to predict bike sharing demand based on weather.
- Provide insights to optimize bike sharing operations according to weather conditions.
